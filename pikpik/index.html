          <h2>1.Spicy Chili Con Carne</h2>
          
          <p>The previous world champion, Carolina Reaper has been beat!  by itself… The Carolina Reaper is once again officially the Worlds Hottest Pepper.</p>
          <p>Originally ranked as world’s hottest in 2013, the Reaper was tested again in 2018 with an even higher SHU. (71,000 SHU higher to be exact) This gives the reaper a renewed title as World’s Hottest!</p>
          <p>It was bred for heat and that it is, with an average SHU of 1,641,000 SHU and peaks at 2.2 Million SHU!</p>
          <p>Let’s put the scoville rating into perspective for you:
            The Carolina Reaper pepper is 200x hotter than a Jalapeno #WorldsHottestPepper
            Just looking at the pictures above, you know its one mean pepper. The Carolina Reaper has a unique stinger tail that is unlike any other pepper and every pod is different!
            It gets this insane heat from being a cross between a Ghost Pepper and a Red Habanero. Oddly enough this pepper doesn’t just have heat, but excellent fruity flavor to boot. Well, that is before it melts your face off.</p>

          <h2>2.Trinidad Moruga Scorpion</h2>
          
            <p>Straight from the depths of hell the Trinidad Scorpion Moruga Blend, AKA Moruga Scorpion, is a rare sought after pepper that was only just recently discovered.</p>

            <p>Native to the lands of Moruga in Trinidad and Tobago. Once you take a bite of this formidable pepper the heat never stops building.</p>

            <p>This pepper may be lacking the Reaper’s stinger, but don’t let that fool you. The Moruga Scorpion is every bit as hot as The Carolina Reaper.</p>

          <section id="3">
            <h2>3.7 Pot Douglah</h2>
            
            <p>Well renown in the pepper community as one of the hottest peppers with the best flavor.</p>

            <p>The 7 Pot Douglah is the hottest pepper you can find that isn’t red.</p>
            
            <p>The hottest “superhot” peppers are traditionally red, but the Douglah defies the odds by being brown AND scortching hot.</p>
            
            <p>You can’t go wrong with fresh, dried, or powdered Douglah on any food.</p>
            
            <p>Also known as 7 Pod Douglah, Chocolate 7 Pod or the 7 Pot Brown.</p>

                <h2>4.7 Pot Primo</h2>
                
                <p>The 7 Pot Primo is very distinctive with its long skinny “tail”.</p>

                <p>This pepper was created by horticulturist Troy Primeaux.</p>

                <p>Some peppers cultivators have tried to replicate the Primo look by breeding their own peppers to have a long stinger.</p>

                <p>When you just look at this pepper, you know it’s going to be INSANELY hot. It coincidentally looks strikingly similar to The Carolina Reaper…</p>
